# QuickMock - Instant API Response Generator

A Chrome Extension for generating mock REST API endpoints instantly. Perfect for frontend development, testing, and prototyping when backend APIs are not ready.

## Features

- **Create Mock Endpoints Instantly**: Paste any JSON, select a method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), and get a unique URL that returns that response.
- **Custom Response Options**: Set status codes, response delays, headers, and simulate network errors.
- **Grouped Endpoints & Projects**: Create collections of mock endpoints for different projects.
- **Shareable & Testable URLs**: Each mock API has a public URL with code examples.
- **Save and Reuse**: Sign in to save endpoints long-term and easily duplicate/edit old mocks.
