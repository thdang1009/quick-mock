# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Product Name
QuickMock ‚Äì Instant API Response Generator

## Objective
Develop a developer-focused web tool or extension that allows users to instantly generate mock REST API endpoints using a given JSON response. Designed for frontend development, testing, and prototyping when backend APIs are not yet ready.

---

## Key Features

### 1. Create Mock Endpoint Instantly
- Paste any JSON into a form.
- Select method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
- Click "Generate" ‚Üí Receive a unique URL that returns that response.
- Endpoint expires after a set time or can be saved permanently.

### 2. Custom Response Options
- Set status code (200, 404, 500...).
- Set response delay (e.g. 500ms, 2s).
- Choose headers (e.g. Content-Type: application/json).
- Option to simulate network error.

### 3. Grouped Endpoints & Projects
- Allow users to create collections or "mock projects."
- Each project can have multiple endpoints with defined paths and methods.

### 4. Shareable & Testable URLs
- Each mock API has a sharable public URL.
- Preview page includes:
  - JSON preview
  - cURL example
  - Fetch/Axios snippets

### 5. Save and Reuse
- Sign-in (optional) to save endpoints long-term.
- Can duplicate/edit old mocks easily.

---

## Non-Functional Requirements
- Fast endpoint creation (<1s).
- Scalable storage (temporary or permanent).
- Secure ‚Äì prevent abuse and code injection.
- Mobile responsive interface.

---

## Target Users
- Frontend developers needing quick fake APIs.
- QA engineers simulating network conditions.
- Dev teams doing parallel backend/frontend work.
- API instructors or tutorial creators.

---

## Technical Stack Suggestion
- Frontend: Vanila Javascript
- Backend: Node.js with Express
- Storage: Firebase, Supabase, or in-memory + TTL for temporary mocks
- Hosting: Vercel / Netlify (for frontend), Cloudflare Workers (for APIs)

---

## Success Metrics
- 10,000+ endpoint generations in first 3 months.
- 1,000+ recurring users with saved mocks.
- Community sharing via dev forums (Reddit, StackOverflow, Dev.to).
- User satisfaction via feedback (NPS > 40).

---

## Future Enhancements (Optional)
- OpenAPI import/export
- Authentication simulation (JWT, OAuth)
- Webhook simulation
- GraphQL mock support

üß™ QuickMock ‚Äì API Mocking Tool

üîç Market Landscape

The API mocking space includes a variety of tools catering to different needs: 

Postman: A comprehensive API platform with mock server capabilities, used by over 30 million developers.  

WireMock: An open-source tool for HTTP mocking, suitable for complex scenarios.  

Mockoon: A desktop application for creating mock APIs locally, emphasizing ease of use.  

Beeceptor: A cloud-based platform for quick API mocking and inspection.  


While these tools are robust, there is a niche for a lightweight, browser-based solution focused on rapid mock creation without extensive setup. 

üìà Potential Metrics for Success

User Adoption: Target 5,000+ active users within the first 3 months. 

Mock Endpoint Creation: Aim for 20,000+ mock endpoints generated in the first 6 months. 

User Retention: Strive for a 40%+ monthly active user retention rate. 

Performance: Ensure mock endpoints respond within 200ms under normal load.
